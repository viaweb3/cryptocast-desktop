## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 10+
- Git
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript, React, and Electron

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cryptocast-desktop.git
   cd cryptocast-desktop
   ```

3. Add the original repository as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/viaweb3/cryptocast-desktop.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

```

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript mode
- Prefer explicit return types for functions
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Avoid `any` type when possible

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow hooks rules (only call at top level)
- Use TypeScript for component props
- Prefer default exports for components

### General

- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Follow conventional commit messages

#### Example:

```typescript
// Good
interface WalletBalance {
  address: string;
  balance: string;
  tokenSymbol: string;
}

/**
 * Retrieves the wallet balance for a specific token
 * @param address Wallet address to query
 * @param tokenAddress Token contract address (null for native token)
 * @returns Promise resolving to wallet balance information
 */
async function getWalletBalance(
  address: string,
  tokenAddress: string | null
): Promise<WalletBalance> {
  // Implementation
}
```

## Testing

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between components

### Writing Tests

- Use Jest for unit and integration tests
- Test both happy path and error cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%)

#### Example:

```typescript
describe('WalletService', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup test environment
  });

  test('should create EVM wallet successfully', async () => {
    const wallet = walletService.createEVMWallet();

    expect(wallet.address).toMatch(/^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$/);
    expect(wallet.encryptedKey).toContain(':');
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests only
npm run test:integration

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```
