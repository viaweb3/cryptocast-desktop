## [1.2.0] - 2025-11-27

### Added
- **Winston Logging System**: Integrated Winston logger library for structured logging across all services
  - Type-safe logger interface with `Record<string, unknown>` for metadata
  - Contextual logging with categories (BLOCKCHAIN, CAMPAIGN, TRANSACTION, WALLET, etc.)
  - Logger singleton pattern with child logger support for better traceability
- **Airdrop Generation Scripts**: Added utility scripts for testing
  - `scripts/generate-evm-airdrop.js`: Generate 333 test EVM addresses with random amounts
  - `scripts/generate-solana-airdrop.js`: Generate 333 test Solana addresses with random amounts
- **Type Definitions**: New type definition files for better TypeScript support
  - `src/main/types/ipc.ts`: IPC channel type definitions
  - `src/types/electron-api.ts`: Electron API type definitions

### Changed
- **Logging**: Replaced all `console.log/error/warn` calls with structured Winston logger
  - BlockchainService: Enhanced error logging with context
  - CampaignEstimator: Improved logging for cost estimation
  - CampaignExecutor: Better transaction execution logging
  - All services: Consistent logging patterns and error handling
- **CI/CD Workflow**: Optimized build pipeline
  - Removed Linux build support (focus on Windows and macOS)
  - Enhanced artifact verification and version naming
  - Improved build script robustness with better error handling
  - Only upload final installer files (.dmg, .exe) to releases, excluding intermediate files
- **Database Schema**: Enhanced with logging support
- **IPC Handlers**: Updated with better type safety
- **Preload Script**: Refactored for improved security and type definitions

### Fixed
- **Release Artifacts**: Fixed release upload to only include installer files
  - Excluded .blockmap files (used for auto-updates, not needed by end users)
  - Excluded helper executables (bundled in main installer)
  - Excluded zip and portable builds (simplified to dmg and NSIS installer only)
  - Reduced release artifacts from 153+ files to just 3 clean installers
- **Build Configuration**: Removed duplicate version numbering in artifact filenames
- **Electron Builder**: Optimized target configurations
  - macOS: Only build DMG (removed zip)
  - Windows: Only build NSIS installer (removed portable)

### Removed

### Technical Improvements
- Enhanced type safety across main process services
- Better error context in all logging calls
- Improved database interaction patterns
- Cleaner IPC communication layer

## [1.0.1] - 2025-01-25

### Fixed
- **BSC Testnet Balance Refresh**: Fixed async/sync mismatch in database queries that prevented balance refresh functionality on BSC testnet
- **Dynamic Native Token Symbols**: Fixed hardcoded "ETH" in insufficient balance messages to use correct native token symbols (BNB, MATIC, etc.)
- **Contract Deployment Gas Limits**: Optimized gas limits for better efficiency:
  - Contract deployment: 700K → 500K gas
  - Token approval: 165K → 47K gas
  - Batch transfer: 14.4M → 5.7M gas
- **Variable Scope Error**: Fixed "nativeBalance is not defined" error during contract deployment balance checks
- **UI Routing**: Fixed campaign detail page return button to show correct destination ("返回仪表盘" instead of "返回活动列表")
- **Token Amount Display**: Simplified total airdrop amount display logic to prevent precision issues

### Changed
- **Gas Estimation**: Enhanced accuracy with chain-specific gas multipliers for different networks
- **UI Terminology**: Updated "Gas 价格" to "GasPrice" for more professional blockchain terminology
- **Currency Display**: Removed fiat currency estimation, focusing on native token costs only
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary debug console.log statements across all service files
- **Wallet Management**: Removed refresh balance functionality from wallet management page for cleaner UI

### Optimized
- **Gas Multipliers**: Implemented chain-specific gas multipliers for accurate cost estimation:
  - Ethereum: 1.0x (baseline)
  - BSC: 0.3x (lower gas costs)
  - Polygon: 0.5x
  - Arbitrum/Optimism/Base: 0.2x
  - Sepolia testnet: 0.1x
- **Safety Buffers**: Reduced gas multiplier from 1.2 to 1.1 and transaction buffer from 10% to 5%
